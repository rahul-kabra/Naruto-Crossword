## JavaScript CrossWord - Naruto

This is a pretty simple crossword developed using JavaScript.

Every word has a length atrribute present beside it in parenthesis and with every correct entry in the crossword, the length keeps reducing.

CSS Grid has been used for setting up the crossword board.

I am very fond of crosswords and Naruto is my favorite anime and this here is a combination of both. So for anyone who is a fan of Naruto will like this.

Please feel free to suggest other ideas or enhancements to make it evern more interesting.
